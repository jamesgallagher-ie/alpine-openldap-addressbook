# An OpenLDAP address book server running in an Alpine docker container

I'm using https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-baseimage-alpine as the base image - mostly because they seem to have a good approach to Docker containers. It necessitate learning about s6!

As this is a learning exercise for me it's probably worth staying clear of using this unless you're prepared to get your hands dirty figuring things out (and allowing for my mistakes)
